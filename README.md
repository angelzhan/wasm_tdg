# WebAssembly : The Definitive Guide

Welcome to the code repository for this book on WebAssembly.

This will include code samples from the books as well as additional
projects and examples of new features as support is added to the
various libraries and runtimes. This will allow me to continue to
discuss things that were not widely supported at the time of writing
including threads, SIMD, etc.
